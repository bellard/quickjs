libFuzzer support for QuickJS
=============================

Build QuickJS with libFuzzer support as follows:

  CONFIG_CLANG=y make libfuzzer

This can be extended with sanitizer support to improve efficacy:

  CONFIG_CLANG=y CONFIG_ASAN=y make libfuzzer


Currently, there are three fuzzing targets defined: fuzz_eval, fuzz_compile and fuzz_regexp.
The above build command will produce an executable binary for each of them, which can be
simply executed as:

  ./fuzz_eval

or with an initial corpus:

  ./fuzz_compile corpus_dir/

or with a predefined dictionary to improve its efficacy:

  ./fuzz_eval -dict fuzz/fuzz.dict

or with arbitrary CLI arguments provided by libFuzzer (https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html).
